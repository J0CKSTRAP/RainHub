RainHub V2

dsc.gg/c00lB055 | Moonsex is ass lmfao ironbrew is 500000 times better

List of officially supported executors:

1. Synapse X

2. Krnl

3. Evon

4. Oxygen U

5. Fluxus

6. WeAreDevs

Those are all the officially supported apis for rainhub v2 note you might get it to work on other apis like wrd and easyexploits but don't cry to me if it doesn't work on an officially unsupported api. RainHub Might take 1 - 2 hours to fix itself after an update is pushed so if it is not working that is why!
